# PPR-logic-gates
Models of logic gates using RNA editing to create start and stop codons

Contains a Jupyter notebook running Julia to model a range of logic gates (buffer, NOT, OR, NOR, AND and NAND gates), each based on using RNA editing to create start or stop codons. This is intended as a teaching aide for introducing modelling of synbio concepts; the models are too simple and the parameters too far from reality to accurately simulate real systems. The notebook is intended to be run via mybinder.org at the URL https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ian-small/PPR-logic-gates/HEAD
